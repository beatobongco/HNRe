# HNRe: Modern Hacker News Reader

Modern, fast, mobile-first, and offline-capable reader for Hacker News.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install` | `npm install`

Installs dependencies to run the project. Not much tbh...

### `yarn startprod` | `npm startprod`

Runs the app in the production mode. Use this command for the best speed! \
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn start` | `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
